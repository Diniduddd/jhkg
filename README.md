A Canadian computer programming competition. Uses Heroku.

To run it on your local machine:

1. create a Python 2 virtualenv using `virtualenv venv`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. gem install foreman
4. foreman start

Dependencies are ruby, gem, python, and virtualenv -- you'll probably have to install them through your OS's package manager.
