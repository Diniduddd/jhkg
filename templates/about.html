<p>JHKG is a Canadian competition in computer programming. It is the spiritual successor to <a href='http://dwite.ca/'>DWITE</a>, and a great way to prepare for the <a href='http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html'>CCC</a>.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>We'll have five contests. September, October, November, January, and February. Then we rest.</p>

<p>Each contest will have four problems in roughly increasing difficulty: two easy ones, two hard ones, and an impossible one that must be approximated.</p>

<p>This may change at any time.</p>
